public class Java17Feature {

    //Java 17 has several new features, including:
    //Sealed classes[when introduced record ?]
    //A new feature that allows for fine-grained extensibility. Classes can be declared as sealed using the modifier sealed, and the classes that can extend a sealed class can be declared using the modifier permits.
    //Pattern matching for switch
    //A preview feature that supports type pattern matching in switch statements. This can improve writing if else chains for type checking.
    //Strongly Encapsulate JDK internals
    //A feature that aims to improve the encapsulation of internal APIs in the JDK. This can limit the use of internal APIs by third-party applications and libraries, which can improve the security and stability of Java applications.
    //New MacOS rendering pipeline
    //A new rendering pipeline that provides better performance and integration with the MacOS ecosystem.
    //Restore always-strict floating-point semantics
    //A feature that restores always-strict floating-point semantics to ease development of numerically-sensitive libraries.
    //Deprecate the security manager for removal
    //A feature that marks the security manager as deprecated for removal. There is no planned replacement for it.
    //Deserialization filters
    //A feature that allows the monitoring and inspection of all deserialization operations performed by the Platform's Serialization API.


// Restore Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics
//Enhanced pseudo-Random Number Generators
//New macOS Rendering pipelines
//macOS/AArch64 Port
//Deprecate the Applet API for Removal

//Deprecate the Security manager for Removal
//Foreign Functions & memory API(Incubator)
//Vector API(Second Incubator)
//Context-Specific Deserialization Filters
