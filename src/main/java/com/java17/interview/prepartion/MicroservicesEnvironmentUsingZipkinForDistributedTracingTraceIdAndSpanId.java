    //In a Spring Boot microservices environment using Zipkin for distributed tracing, traceId and spanId are identifiers used to track and understand the flow of requests across different services. Here’s a breakdown of what they are and how they function.
    //
    //1. Trace ID (traceId)
    //Definition: A traceId is a unique identifier for an entire request journey across multiple microservices.
    //Purpose: It helps trace a single request from start to finish, across multiple services in a distributed system.
    //Usage: When a request starts in one microservice and calls other services down the line, each service involved in handling this request will share the same traceId. This enables Zipkin (or any tracing tool) to visualize the full path and timing of the request across services.
    //2. Span ID (spanId)
    //Definition: A spanId is a unique identifier for a single unit of work within a trace, often corresponding to an individual operation or method call within a service.
    //Purpose: spanId helps to divide the traceId into smaller, measurable units, showing where time is spent within each service.
    //Usage: In a trace, each service operation or method invocation generates a spanId. This allows Zipkin to break down the trace into individual spans, showing the time spent in each part of the request processing.
    //Example Flow
    //Let’s say a request originates in Service A, which then calls Service B and Service C:
    //
    //Trace ID: Every span created by Service A, Service B, and Service C for this request will share the same traceId.
    //Span ID:
    //Service A creates a span with its own spanId.
    //When Service A calls Service B, Service B creates a new span with a different spanId.
    //Similarly, when Service B calls Service C, Service C creates another new span with its own spanId.
    //These spanIds are linked by parent-child relationships, helping Zipkin visualize the entire call hierarchy.
    //Example Trace in Zipkin
    //Service	Trace ID	Span ID	Parent Span ID
    //Service A	abc123	1a2b3c	(none)
    //Service B	abc123	4d5e6f	1a2b3c
    //Service C	abc123	7g8h9i	4d5e6f
    //Summary
    //Trace ID (traceId): Unique to the entire request journey across all services.
    //Span ID (spanId): Unique to each individual operation or call within a service.
    //Parent Span ID: Links spanIds to form a tree structure, showing relationships between service calls.
    //These identifiers allow Zipkin and other tracing systems to provide insights into the performance and behavior of distributed applications by tracking requests across multiple services.
