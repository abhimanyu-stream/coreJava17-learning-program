		//We can prevent(stop) a Thread execution by using the following methods.

		//1) yield();

		// yield() method causes “to pause current executing Thread for giving the chance of remaining waiting Threads of same priority”.
 		//If all waiting Threads have the low priority or if there is no waiting Threads then the same Thread will be continued its execution.
 		//If several waiting Threads with same priority available then we can’t expect exact which Thread will get chance for execution.
		//The Thread which is yielded when it get chance once again for execution is depends on mercy of the Thread scheduler.
 		//public static native void yield();
		//Thread.yield();// yield is a static method

		//2) join();

        //If a Thread wants to wait until completing some other Thread, then we should go for join() method.

        //2) public final void join(long ms) throws InterruptedException
        //3) public final void join(long ms,int ns) throws InterruptedException

		//3) sleep();

        //If a Thread don’t want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time then we should go for sleep() method.
